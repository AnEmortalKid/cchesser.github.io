      <description>I previously posted a set of design principles about building presentation slides. In this post, I shared how you can improve the effectiveness of your visual aides, by authoring your own images. This post is going to be a simple starter of how I began including images in my presentations and notes.
Equipment Required For this tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;m using the following equipment:
 Dry erase whiteboard and a black marker iPhone (can be pretty old like mine) and using its built in Camera app Preview app on macOS  You can of course use other equipment to do this tutorial, but I wanted to share how I started capturing my images in a very basic way.</description>

      <description>I previously posted a short set of notes of how I apply my simple process of digesting emails. However, I think there are some other important rules of when to produce email. In this short post, I will share a couple things to keep in mind before you send an email.
Email is where your keystrokes go to die Several years back, I watched this talk by Scott Hanselman on Scaling Yourself, which touches on several topics on how to improve your productivity.</description>

      <description>The pptx Language A few months ago, I was speaking with a senior member of our engineering leadership team, and he stated that the only language he has been coding in lately, is pptx (referring to the file extension of Microsoft PowerPoint). While this statement was delivered with humor, I found it to be true with many engineers. As they grew with experience, so did the amount of time they spent giving presentations.</description>

      <description>Over the course of my engineering career, I have seen and participated in different types of team traditions. Team traditions can help build the identity or brand of a team, which is generally helpful in supporting the overall health of the team. By having a team which has a unique and strong identity, it many times indicates a strong connective bond between the team members. As the lifespan of a team grows over time, traditions can continue to form which further crystalize these unique elements of their identity.</description>

      <description>As I talk with other engineers, I have found a common question that typically arises on &amp;ldquo;How do you make time to stay current on technology?&amp;rdquo; Other flavors of the same question are, &amp;ldquo;What podcasts do you listen to?&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;How do you find technical articles that are good to read?&amp;rdquo; While I seek these same things, I find that many times people do not often talk about how can they optimize how their brain can process the things they have been learning.</description>

      <description>As I have explored ways to be more productive, I generally find that everyone has a way in which they process their emails. Given that email is such a common element of communication that everyone deals with, and it has been around for a long time, there are generally several different ways of optimizing this continuous amount of content. Here is my process of how I manage my email at work, which I realize is quite simple.</description>

      <description>Here are some of the guides I have built. These are intended to be concise that can be printed on a single page. I prefer to build these guides based on talks I have given, where they serve as simple set of notes that hopefully can further remind others of the content. Some of these are very basic, essentially just an image to help serve as a reminder of content.</description>

      <description>Diagnose Your Lethargic JVM   If you are building Java Virtual Machine based services, a core measurement of your success is performance. The act of measuring and analyzing how your code is performing becomes an essential activity in all phases of your development. This skill becomes even more critical once you are required to troubleshoot and evaluate your service in a unique production environment. Understanding what operations are consuming most of our CPU time, as well as, what areas of your code are wasting resources will greatly improve your ability to diagnose a sluggish JVM.</description>
